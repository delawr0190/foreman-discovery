# foreman-discovery

foreman-discovery provides a Java application that will query a cgminer running at the desired IP and port (prompted at runtime, but `port` is typically `4028`).  The following commands are executed against the cgminer API:

```
{"command":"summary"}
{"command":"stats"}
{"command":"pools"}
```

Their responses are placed into `summary.json`, `stats.json`, and `pools.json`, respectively.
